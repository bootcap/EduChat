# Chat-App
A real time chat application done with tauri and react with a firebase backend

# Note
This branch is done with tauri. The old version which is done with electron is accessible here: https://github.com/waveyboym/Chat-App/tree/read-only-old-version.
The old version will no longer receive updates and/or fixes. I'm just putting it up in case anyone might want to have access to it.
